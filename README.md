##Inspiration

Students waste time every day trying to figure out which schedule MVHS is on. PDFs, screenshots, announcements, and random posts all create confusion. I wanted one clean source that answers the question instantly.

##What it does

It shows today’s schedule automatically, displays the current period, and gives a live countdown to the next one. Students can also switch between Regular, Block, Late Start, or Rally schedules manually.

##How we built it

The project uses HTML, CSS/Tailwind for styling, and JavaScript for schedule logic and timers. Data for each schedule type is stored in structured JSON-like objects. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages for fast, free deployment.

##Challenges we ran into

Handling different schedule variations without breaking the timer logic was tricky. Making the UI simple enough for students while keeping all schedules accessible also required multiple redesigns.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

The app loads instantly, works on any device, and actually solves a daily problem. It removes confusion and gives MVHS a reliable single source for schedules.

##What we learned

We learned how to structure real-time JS logic, optimize UI for speed, and deploy cleanly on GitHub Pages. Also learned the value of solving one problem extremely well.

##What's next for MVHS Schedule Tracker

Add notifications for period changes, integrate a weekly calendar view, improve accessibility, and allow teachers to broadcast temporary schedule changes (rallies, events, delays).
